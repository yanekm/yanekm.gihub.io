# Guerilla InfoSec

Inspired by the Agile Manifesto, and conversations with Brian
Scardina.

We are unconvering better ways of securing software and systems by
doing it and helping others do it.   Through this work we have come
to value:

## Automated discovery over manual on-boarding and configuration.

## Working inspections and controls over written documentation sparsely followed.

## Informative advisory over Break/Block.

## Continuous re-inspection over scheduled audits. 

## Global Coverage over sporadic inclusion.
